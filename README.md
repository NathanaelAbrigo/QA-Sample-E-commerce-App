# QA Sample E Commerce Web App

This project uses **Playwright** for UI testing and **Newman** (Postmanâ€™s CLI) for API testing. It also includes a simple **CI/CD setup with GitHub Actions**.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This is a practice QA project where we:
- **Test the UI** of a demo web app (e.g., login form, navigation, form submission).
- **Test API endpoints** (e.g., GET, POST requests for users or posts).
- **Incorporate CI/CD** so tests run automatically on GitHub whenever we push code.

This will practice:

âœ… Writing UI tests with Playwright  
âœ… Running API tests using Postman + Newman  
âœ… Integrating tests into a CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions)

## Project Setup

1. **Initialize project and install tools**

```bash
npm init playwright@latest  # Playwright for UI tests
npm install -D newman       # Newman for API tests
```

2. **Create and Export Postman Collection**
   - Open Postman app or web.
   - Create a new collection or open an existing one.
   - Add your API requests (e.g., login, get products).
   - Click the 3-dot menu next to your collection â†’ Export â†’ choose Collection v2.1 â†’ save as postman_collection.json
   - Put exported file in tests/api/
     
3. **Update package.json Scripts**
```json
"scripts": {
  "test:ui": "npx playwright test",
  "test:api": "newman run tests/api/postman_collection.json"
},
```

4. **Setup Github Actions for CI/CD**
